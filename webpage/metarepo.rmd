# GCAM-China v7 Overview
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

This documentation describes GCAM-China v7, which is developed based on GCAM v7.1 with selected updates from GCAM v7 and specific features for GCAM-China. 
For documentation of GCAM, please go to: [jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/](https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/).

GCAM-China disaggregates the energy-economic system of the China region into 31 province-level sub-regions and six electricity grid regions that are also embedded in the global GCAM model. Electricity generation and end-use energy demand (buildings, transportation, and industry) are modeled at the provincial level in GCAM-China, and the model allows for electricity trade within grid regions. Renewable energy resources (hydro, solar, and wind) and carbon storage resources are also provincial-specific. Primary production of fossil resources including oil, gas, and coal, as well as other energy transformation sectors (hydrogen, gas, and refined liquids production) are still modeled at the aggregate national level. Agricultural and land use activities, including the supply of biomass energy feedstocks (residues and dedicated energy crops) are modeled at the level of 12 water basins in China.

Updates from GCAM-China v6:

- Harmonized with core GCAM v7.1 features
- Multiple income groups in residential building sector
- Provincial CH4 and N2O emissions in energy end-use sectors
- Provincial biomass markets
- Provincial wind and solar resource curves

# Get Started
<p align="center"> <img src="images/divider.png"></p>

<span style="font-size: larger;">GCAM-China repository: [https://github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china](https://github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china)</span>

For a quick start, download a zipped version of the latest release from [umd-cgs/gcam-china/releases](https://github.com/umd-cgs/gcam-china/releases) for either PC or Mac and the prerequisite software. Then double click on the run-gcam executable file (run-gcam.bat for Windows / run-gcam.command for Mac) within the exe folder. This will run GCAM-China using the configuration.xml which is a copy of configuration_china.xml. Once the input files have been read into the model and the model has run through all the timesteps it will output a database to the output/database_basexdb folder. 

The results in this database can be accessed and queried using the model interface which is opened using the run-model-interface executable file (run-model-interface.bat for Windows / ModelInterface.app for Mac) within the ModelInterface folder. For analyzing the results, keep in mind that there is a ‘GCAM China’ section to the Main_queries.xml file, which is used by the model interface. This section contains primary energy, electricity, refined liquids, and aggregated final energy queries which should be used instead of the corresponding queries in the standard section (‘energy’). Additionally, in order to get results for China as a whole, select all of the provinces as well as the ‘China’ region when running a query. 

For more detailed instructions for running the model and accessing the results see the core GCAM user guide: https://jgcri.github.io/gcam-doc/user-guide.html
